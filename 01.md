XHTML Basics
============

What XHTML Is and Is Not
------------------------

XHTML<sup>[[1](#References)]</sup> is a "markup language" - that is, it describes information. Specifically, it describes the *structure* of information, such as a paragraph, a table, an article, etc. It draws on a print analogy, but it's not restricted to visual display; it is used by programs to transform information into other media, such as synthesized speech for a blind Web user, and to compile enormous data stores which can then be mined for information by other programs.

XHTML is **not** for specifying how a browser should format text or arrange it on a screen; those are the responsibility of [CSS](css.md). In the past, (X)HTML has been used for those purposes, but CSS has steadily matured to shoulder them. Parts of XHTML can still manage them, but very few are intended for it and not deprecated (off limits, only retained so old pages don't break).

A Simple Web Page
-----------------

So here's the simple Web page I promised:

    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Untitled Document (wait...)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>Hello, world!</div>
    </body>
    </html>

To view that in your browser:

* In Visual Studio, select File > New File...
* In the General section, select Text File and click Open (because HTML File gives you stuff I explain in the *next* lesson).
* Paste the code above into the file.
* Select File > Save TextFile1.txt As...
* Double-click the Static folder.
* Enter 01.html as the filename and click Save.

Of course, you could just as well save it in [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (you *do* have [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)?), but Visual Studio is better tailored to software development, including XHTML.

Okay, What Was All That Stuff?
------------------------------

The first line is necessary to keep the browser predictable in how it renders the page. Without a doctype it can't tell whether this is a sloppy page that needs special favors. &lt;html&gt; is an **opening tag**, and &lt;/html&gt; is its matching **closing tag**. The same goes for all the other words between angle brackets. The tags are understood as a heirarchy by the browser, with each tag pair represented by a **node** in the **document tree**. Tag pairs correspond to a certain type of node, **elements**.

A *head* element contains information about a page - meta-data.

A *title* element's content is put in the title bar (in tabbed browsers, this is the page's tab). 

A *body* element contains the rendered portion of a page. Not all visible elements may be placed directly inside.

Up to now all the elements must occur no more than once in a page; *div* elements are the exception. They represent a division of the page - on screens, some rectangular area. They don't have much meaning, so we have other elements that do the same thing but are understood with specific meanings.
