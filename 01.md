XHTML Basics
============

What XHTML Is and Is Not
------------------------

[XHTML](xhtml.md) is a "markup language" - that is, it describes information. Specifically, it describes the *structure* of information, such as a paragraph, a table, an article, etc. It draws on a print analogy, but it's not restricted to visual display; it is used by programs to transform information into other media, such as synthesized speech for a blind Web user, and to compile enormous data stores which can then be mined for information by other programs.

XHTML is **not** for specifying how a browser should format text or arrange it on a screen; those are the responsibility of [CSS](css.md). In the past, (X)HTML has been used for those purposes, but CSS has steadily matured to shoulder them. Parts of XHTML can still manage them, but very few are intended for it and not deprecated (off limits, only retained so old pages don't break).

A Simple Web Page
-----------------

So here's the simple Web page I promised:

    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Untitled Document (wait...)</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>Hello, world!</div>
    </body>
    </html>

Save that as 01.html, or something else ending in .html, and double-click it in Windows Explorer. Your browser will utter the timeless words used for first applications of almost every digital language.

Okay, What Was All That Stuff?
------------------------------

The first line is necessary to keep the browser predictable in how it renders the page. Without a doctype it can't tell whether this is a sloppy page that needs special favors. &lt;html&gt; is an **opening tag**, and &lt;/html&gt; is its matching **closing tag**. The same goes for all the other words between angle brackets. The tags are understood as a heirarchy by the browser, with each tag pair represented by a **node** in the **document tree**. Tag pairs correspond to a certain type of node, **elements**.

A *head* element contains information about a page - meta-data.

A *title* element's content is put in the title bar (in modern browsers, this is the page's tab). 

A *body* element contains the visible portion of a page. Not all visible elements may be placed directly inside.

Up to now all the elements must occur no more than once in a page; *div* elements are the exception. They represent a division of the page - on screens, some rectangular area. They don't have much meaning, so we have other elements that do the same thing but are understood with specific meanings.
