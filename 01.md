[XHTML](xhtml.md) is a "markup language" - that is, it describes information. Specifically, it describes the *structure* of information, such as a paragraph, a table, an article, etc. It draws on a print analogy, but it's not restricted to visual display; it is used by programs to transform information into other media, such as synthesized speech for a blind Web user, and to compile enormous data stores which can then be mined for information by other programs.

XHTML is **not** for specifying how a browser should format text or arrange it on a screen; those are the responsibility of [CSS](css.md). In the past, (X)HTML has been used for those purposes, but CSS has steadily matured to shoulder them. Parts of XHTML can manage them, but very few are intended for it and not deprecated (off limits, only retained so old pages don't break).
