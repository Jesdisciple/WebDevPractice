git
===

[**git**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a [**V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control). **GitHub**, where you are probably reading this tutorial, is a Web hosting service for git-based projects. And [**TortoiseGit**](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) is a graphical client<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup> for git (ignore "GitHub for Windows," advertised on GitHub; it stinks). For finer control, you can use the git command-line client<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup>; ask me about that if you care.

Version control (or revision control, or source control) is important in the wider software industry. So when it seemed to be the convenient way to present this tutorial I brushed aside concerns over usability because you need to learn it anyway.

Many other VCSs exist, but the big four are git, Subversion (svn), Mercurial (hg), and CVS, in no particular order. I won't explain the differences here, but I think it's good to know the names.
