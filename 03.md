Lesson 03: XHTML in Visual Studio
=================================

A Web Page from Just a Few Clicks
---------------------------------

Visual Studio makes Web pages that are very similar to what I already showed you (imagine that):

* In Visual Studio, select File > New File...
* In the General (or Web) section, select HTML File and click Open.
* Select File > Save HtmlPage1.html As...
* Double-click the Static folder.
* Enter 03.html as the filename and click Save.

Your Three New Best Friends
---------------------------

The new page includes a few differences from 02.html. First, the *html* element has two **attributes**, *lang* and *xmlns*. An attribute specifies information about an element - in this case, information about the page. Attributes always look like name="value".<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup>

The *lang* attribute specifies that the language of the page is "en" (English). This is used, for example, by Google Search when it decides whether to offer a translation of a result.

The *xmlns* namespace must have that same value in all XHTML pages; that's what specifies that they are, in fact, written in XHTML rather than in **M**y **R**andom **M**arkup **L**anguage. Incidentally, w3.org is the website of the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, which is the organization that defines XHTML, CSS, and a bunch of other Web technologies.
