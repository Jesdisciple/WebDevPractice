Lesson 03: XHTML in Visual Studio
=================================

A Web Page from Just a Few Clicks
---------------------------------

Visual Studio makes Web pages that are very similar to what I already showed you (imagine that):

* In Visual Studio, select File > New File...
* In the General (or Web) section, select HTML File and click Open.

Your New Friends
----------------

The new page includes a few differences from 02.html. First, the *html* element has two **attributes**, *lang* and *xmlns*. An attribute specifies information about an element - in this case, information about the page. Attributes always look like name="value".<sup>[[1](#references)]</sup> Attributes are not allowed in closing tags.

The *lang* attribute specifies that the language of the page is "en" (English). This is used, for example, by Google Search when it decides whether to offer a translation of a result.

The *xmlns* (XML<sup>[[2](#references)]</sup>&nbsp;**n**ame&#8203;**s**&#8203;pace) attribute must have that same value in all XHTML pages; that's what specifies that they are, in fact, written in XHTML rather than in **M**y **R**andom **M**arkup **L**anguage. Incidentally, w3.org is the website of the [World Wide Web Consortium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium), or W3C, which is the organization that defines XHTML, CSS, and a bunch of other Web technologies.

A *meta* tag can specify any information about a page that the W3C didn't think to make a special tag for. This one tells the browser to use the [UTF-8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) [character set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding). This needs to be<sup>[[3](#references)]</sup> the same character set as the server used to send the page to the client.<sup>[[4](#references)]</sup>

XHTML Validation
----------------

If you delete the &gt; (right angle bracket, or greater-than symbol) from the end of the closing *html* tag (or any tag, really), your document will be invalid XHTML. Go ahead and do it. After a moment, a green squiggly line appears below that tag. Now at the bottom of the Visual Studio window, click the "Error List" tab. A panel pops up with a warning (which really should be an error) that your page is invalid due to a missing right angle bracket. Click the thumb-tack icon at the top of the panel to make that stack of panels stay visible. (Other panels in that position, such as results from a search "in files," in Edit > Find and Replace, can still hide your error list, but at least that will be obvious now.)

If Visual Studio weren't validating the page for you, or we knew it to have a bug in its validation routine, we would be reliant upon the W3C for our validation: http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

1. That is, in valid XHTML. This isn't always true in HTML; see [here](xhtml.md) for how they relate to each other, or [here](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML) for exactly how different they are.

3. Generally it can be omitted, but you might get a mean surprise if the browser's guess were different from what the server used; some character sets use more or less memory for each character, so the word "so" could be taken as a two-byte character that would not at all be what you meant. If you're using any exotic (non-Latin or decorated Latin) characters (such as proper German), these could be rendered as different exotic characters, from a different character set.
