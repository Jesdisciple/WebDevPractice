This propject is intended as a tutorial for:

1. XHTML 5
2. CSS 3
3. ASP.NET MVC 4 with C# 5
4. ECMAScript 5

It is primarily to be read by my brother; material may be missing or specific to his environment. Specifically, his environment includes:

| Operating System | Editor                             | Primary Browser |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Windows 7        | Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web | Firefox         |

Get Visual Studio [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web). Note that it's not the same Visual Studio as you would use to make a desktop application. Also, I consider these steps essential to its setup:

* Enable line numbers: Tools > Options... > Text Editor > All Languages > Line numbers
* [Kill the capital menu names.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10859173/how-to-disable-all-caps-menu-titles-in-visual-studio)
* Get a theme that's less of an eyesore: Tools > Options... > Environment > Color theme = Dark

Make sure you have these browsers installed:

* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
* Internet Explorer ... Oh, duh.

Finally, [TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) will help you download the files from this project, although you can just grab them through your browser.

1. Open Windows Explorer (press the Windows key and E) and browse to where you want to put your code.
2. Create a new folder (Ctrl+N) and name it WebDevPractice.
3. Right-click it and select Git Clone.
4. Enter https://github.com/Jesdisciple/WebDevPractice.git in the dialog window and click OK.

When you need to get updates I've posted to the server, right-click WebDevPractice and press Git Sync..., then Pull. If you make changes you regret, I can tell you how to revert them. If you make changes you want to push to the server, we can do that too.
