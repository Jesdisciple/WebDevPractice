It is primarily to be read by my brother; material may be missing or specific to his environment. Specifically, his environment includes:

| Operating System | Editor                             | Primary Browser |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Windows 7        | Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web | Firefox         |

Advice specific to my brother will be in blockquotes, like so:

> Oh yeah, you don't actually have Visual Studio yet. Get it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web). Note that it's not the same Visual Studio as you would use to make a desktop application.

Make sure you have these browsers installed:

* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
* Internet Explorer ... Oh, duh.
