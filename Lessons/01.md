It is primarily to be read by my brother; material may be missing or specific to his environment. Specifically, his environment includes:

| Operating System | Editor                             | Primary Browser |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Windows 7        | Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web | Firefox         |

Advice specific to my brother will be in blockquotes, like so:

> Oh yeah, you don't actually have Visual Studio yet. Get it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web).
> Note that it's not the same Visual Studio as you would use to make a desktop application. Also, I consider these steps essential to its setup:
> * Enable line numbers: Tools > Options... > Text Editor > All Languages > Line numbers
> * [Kill the capital menu names.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10859173/how-to-disable-all-caps-menu-titles-in-visual-studio)
> * Get a theme that's less of an eyesore: Tools > Options... > Environment > Color theme = Dark
