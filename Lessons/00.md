This propject is intended as a tutorial for:

1. XHTML 5
2. CSS 3
3. ASP.NET MVC 4 with C# 5
4. ECMAScript 5

The tutorial will assume that it is followed linearly, with the technologies learned in the listed order. It is primarily to be read by my brother; material may be missing or specific to his environment. Specifically, his environment includes:

| Operating System | Editor                             | Primary Browser |
|------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Windows 7        | Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web | Firefox         |

Get Visual Studio [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web). Note that it's not the same Visual Studio as you would use to make a desktop application. Also, I consider these steps essential to its setup:

* Enable line numbers: Tools > Options... > Text Editor > All Languages > Line numbers
* [Kill the capital menu names.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10859173/how-to-disable-all-caps-menu-titles-in-visual-studio)
* Get a theme that's less of an eyesore: Tools > Options... > Environment > Color theme = Dark

Make sure you have these browsers installed:

* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
* Internet Explorer ... Oh, duh.

Use the project name "WebDevPractice" in [these instructions](http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/intro-to-aspnet-mvc-4) up to the point where you have an "Internet Application" (named WebDevPractice). This just makes it easy to use the same VS project throughout the tutorial. Don't worry about exactly what it adds to your folder; it won't affect you until I explain it.

[TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/) will help you download the files from this project, although you can just grab them through your browser. Regardless, I'll be guiding you through creating roughly the same thing yourself anyway. This is just so you can compare what you make against what I mean; you don't need to do this until you want my files on your computer.

1. Open Windows Explorer (press the Windows key and E) and browse to where you want to put your code (somewhere away from your own project, as they have the same name).
3. Right-click the emptiness and select Git Clone.
4. Enter https://github.com/Jesdisciple/WebDevPractice.git in the dialog window and click OK. A folder named WebDevPractice will be created with the files from GitHub in it.

When you need to get updates I've posted to the server, right-click WebDevPractice and press Git Sync..., then Pull. If you make changes you later regret, I can tell you how to revert them. If you make changes you want to push to the server, we can do that too.

Alright, now you have your environment; you've completed lesson #0. Next up, you'll [make a simple Web page](01.md).
