Project Setup
-------------

Use the project name "Dynamic" with [these instructions](http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/mvc-4/getting-started-with-aspnet-mvc4/intro-to-aspnet-mvc-4) up to the point where you have an "Internet Application" (named Dynamic). This just makes it easy to use the same VS project throughout the tutorial. Don't worry about exactly what it adds to your folder; it won't affect you until I explain it.
