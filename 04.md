Lesson 04: Another Way to Weave a Tangled Web
=============================================

This Spider Weaves with Chain
-----------------------------

The World Wide Web got its name, not from the physical network of wires and signals we use to communicate (that's the Internet), but from its most recognizable feature: **hyperlinks**. (That's also where HTML got its "hypertext.") If the Web can be said to have a shape, it is formed from the hyperlinks in pages. Anytime a URL occurs in a page, in a way that is meaningful to browsers, that's a link. The most well-known type of link is the kind that we click to view more content, called an **anchor**. (The terminology just walks all over any attempt at a metaphor.)

An anchor is placed in HTML with the *a* tag, and the URL goes in its *href* (hyper-reference) attribute:

    <a href="http://www.example.com/">Here</a> you go!

Take a Swing at It
------------------

* Open Visual Studio and select your solution from File > Recent Projects and Solutions.
* In the Solution Explorer panel on the right, double-click index.html.
* Just after your opening *body* tag, press the Enter key, then the Tab key. When an element is nested inside another, its tags are generally indented one more level than those of its parent.
* Paste this where your cursor is now:

    <a href="02.html">example from lesson 02</a>

* Click the green arrow to test your site.
* If you like, change the HTML file to see how the page in the browser reacts.
