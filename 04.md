Lesson 04: Letters and Reports and Notes, Oh My!
================================================

This Spider Weaves with Chain
-----------------------------

The World Wide Web got its name, not from the physical network of wires and signals we use to communicate (that's the Internet), but from its most recognizable feature: **hyperlinks**. (That's also where HTML got its "hypertext.") If the Web can be said to have a shape, it is formed from the hyperlinks in pages. Anytime a URL occurs in a page, in a way that is meaningful to browsers, that's a link. The most well-known type of link is the kind that we click to view more content, called an **anchor**. (The terminology just walks all over any attempt at a metaphor.)

An anchor is placed in HTML with the `a` tag, and the URL goes in its `href` (hyper-reference) attribute:

    <a href="http://www.example.com/">Here</a> you go!

Take a Swing at It
------------------

1. Open Visual Studio and select your solution from File > Recent Projects and Solutions.

2. In the Solution Explorer panel on the right, double-click index.html.

3. Just after your opening `body` tag, press the Enter key, then the Tab key. When an element is nested inside another, its tags are generally indented one more level than those of its parent. Visual Studio will ensure that a new line begins with as much indentation as the previous one.

4. Paste this where your cursor is now:
        
        <a href="02.html">example from lesson 02</a>
        
5. Click the green arrow to test your site. If you like, change the HTML file to see how the browser reacts.

Absolute and Relative Paths
---------------------------

If your `href` starts with `http://`, where it refers to is obvious, but what about the above `02.html`? How did that find our file? An `href` can be either a URL or a **path**; URLs start with something like `xxx://`, so ours is a path. If a path starts with `/`, it's **absolute**; otherwise, it's **relative**. Relative paths start from the "current" or "working" directory, so we want the file 02.html from the same directory as the current page.

If a path is absolute, it starts from the "webroot" of the website. For example, the absolute path of this file, on the GitHub server, is `/Jesdisciple/WebDevPractice/blob/master/04.md`. It implies that there's not really anything "above" the Jesdisciple directory, but that's only because what's there is none of our business. Your webroot is the folder for your Static project, so we could instead have linked to `/02.html`.

At this point, you might think that if the file you want to link to isn't in all the same directories as the one to contain the link, you need to use an absolute path. Not so; `..` means the containing directory, and it can be chained: `../../..` ascends three directories. (You can use that to get an error from your server for trying to look at its private parts.) Its sister is `.`, which means the current directory and doesn't come in handy often; `02.html` is the same thing as `./02.html`.

Take It for a Spin
------------------

Now that you have paragraphs and links, you can make a simple set of text-only pages. Put your Lego stories in them, or make notes for yourself about XHTML. Whatever content you put in them, make sure to mark each paragraph with a `p` element and link the pages together.
