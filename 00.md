Lesson 00: Setting Up Your Environment
======================================

Editor
------

Get Visual Studio [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web). Note that it's not the same Visual Studio as you would use to make a desktop application. Also, I consider these steps essential to its setup:

* Enable line numbers: Tools > Options... > Text Editor > All Languages > Line numbers
* [Kill the capital menu names.](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10859173/how-to-disable-all-caps-menu-titles-in-visual-studio)
* Get a theme that's less of an eyesore: Tools > Options... > Environment > Color theme = Dark

Browsers
--------

Make sure you have these browsers installed:

* [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/)
* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)
* Internet Explorer ... Oh, duh.

Project Setup
-------------

Open Visual Studio (listed as "VS Express 2012 for Web" in your Start menu) and select File > New Project... Fill the dialog out as follows:

* Name: "Static" (this is the project name)
* Location: Wherever you want to keep your code.
* Solution name: "WebDevPractice" (a solution can hold multiple projects)

Leave the check boxes as they are and click OK.

TortoiseGit
-----------

This section is just so you can compare what you make against what I mean; you don't need to do this until you want my files on your computer. Regardless, I'll be guiding you through creating roughly the same thing yourself, and you can just grab them through your browser anyway.

**If you intend to do this, please let me know, as I want to check for a setting in the installer.**

[TortoiseGit](https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/)<sup>[[1](#References)]</sup> can help you download the files from this project and keep them current.

1. Open Windows Explorer (press the Windows key and E) and browse to where you want to put your code (somewhere away from your own project, as they have the same name).
3. Right-click the emptiness and select Git Clone.
4. Enter https://github.com/Jesdisciple/WebDevPractice.git in the dialog window and click OK. A folder named WebDevPractice will be created with the files from GitHub in it.

When you need to get updates I've posted to the server, right-click WebDevPractice and press Git Sync..., then Pull. If you make changes you later regret, I can tell you how to revert them. If you make changes you want to push to the server, we can do that too.
