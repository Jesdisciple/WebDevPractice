The Client-Server Model
=======================

Use of the Internet involves pairs of computers exchanging messages. Generally, some computers are more popular than others; they don't all talk to each other equally. The more poular ones, called **servers**, also generally don't initiate conversations, except maybe with other servers. The less popular ones, and the ones you're more likely to actually see, are **clients**. This is known as the **client-server model**, and it's fundamental to the Web and most other applications of the Internet. (Computers are sometimes more egalitarian, and then they're known as **peers** and engage in **peer-to-peer** (P2P) interaction.)

The software which causes a computer to act as a client or server is also known by the same term. So, for example, Web browsers are a type of Web client, GitHub runs (one or more) git servers on its physical servers, and Visual Studio comes packaged with a Web server.
